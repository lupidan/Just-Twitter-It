Just-Twitter-It
===============

This project contains code for iOS to post a Twitter tweet using web login and intents.

Now, it's difficult to find an easy way to make a simple tweet in Twitter. JustTwitterIt purpose is to make the process simple. The code does not contain JSON or XML parser, the code doesn't make use of a Consumer secret or a Consumer Key. It just uses a UIWebView, URL tracking and a cookie control.

If you want to use your own twitter app (secret+key) to post to a twitter timeline, this code will not be useful, since it uses the official twitter web to post a tweet.

If you want to be able to retrieve the list of followers, of messages, the mentions, etc... this code doesn't do that.

On the other hand, if you just want to post a tweet, this code JUST TWITTER IT :)
